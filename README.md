# Rick & Morty iOS App

## Assignment
This app is based on an assignment from AckeeCZ -> [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AckeeCZ/ios-task-rick-and-morty?tab=readme-ov-file). Feel free to use it as inspiration for any project! üòä

### Requirements

- [x] The app must be written in Swift.  
- [x] Define the UI of the app however you like (we've heard SwiftUI is the new cool thing now üòé).  
- [x] Use any asynchronous framework you fancy, such as Combine, ReactiveSwift, or native async/await.  
- [x] Follow the MVVM architecture or Composable architecture.  
- [x] Ensure the app adheres to the system's Dark Mode settings.  
- [x] The application should run on all devices and orientations (note: we don‚Äôt have separate designs for tablets).  
- [ ] Use third-party libraries, technologies, and frameworks as needed‚Äîbut have a solid reason for including any of them.  
- [x] Feel free to add any extra features! (Psst, we ‚ù§Ô∏è testing.)  
- [ ] Submit your work as a link to your Git repository containing the source code.  

### Additional Tasks

- [x] Localized strings ‚Äì could be useful on other planets! ü™ê
- [x] Cached images.  
- [x] Save characters to favorites (not just their IDs) ‚Äì Now available offline (favorites page only).  
- [x] Error handling with `Retry` enabled.  
- [x] MVVM-R (MVVM enhanced with a Router).  
- [x] Display all data for an empty search (maybe a bug, maybe a feature üòÑ ‚Äì can be easily fixed in `TableView` based on `isSearching`).  
- [x] Design supporting iPads and iPhone landscape ‚Äì small rearrangements in the Character Detail view.  
- [x] Unit tests for Utils and an example of testing the Rick & Morty API service with mocked data.  
- [x] Swiftlint for check code style
- [x] Design structure base on [Atomic desing](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) for easy reuse in another part of app

### Bugs in Figma
- Different colors between dark and light modes ‚Äì The app changes colors based on the color scheme.  
- Incorrect value in the dark color `backgroundsBottomNavigation` ‚Äì The app uses the value from Figma, not from the string.  

## Architecture

The architecture follows [MVVM-C](https://medium.com/sudo-by-icalia-labs/ios-architecture-mvvm-c-introduction-1-6-815204248518) with a service layer. Services and UI components are separated into SPM for easier maintenance, removal of cyclic dependencies, cleaner code, and future reusability.

### Services

Services should be stateless and reusable across different projects, such as other iOS or tvOS apps. In the app, services should be hidden behind a protocol and accessed via the `InjectionContainer`. This allows them to be easily replaced‚Äîfor example, swapping a REST API implementation with a GraphQL implementation or a mock/stub for testing purposes.

## APIService

The base API service handles error states and parses [DTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) objects into app models.

## RickAndMortyAPIService

An API service implementing the Rick and Morty [REST](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest) API.

## DatabaseService

A database service using SwiftData to store favorite characters and enable data fetching in offline mode.

## Locs

A static helper for localizing strings. In the future, it could allow users to change the app's language. Currently supported languages:

- English

### Components

UI components are separated using [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) and extended with a Style package, which enables easy redesign of the app, particularly for colors and fonts.
